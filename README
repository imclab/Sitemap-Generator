This script will scan all the pages of a given domain and produce a
sitemap.xml file in the current directory, using the Last-Modified
header of each page if one is sent. Only pages returning a Content-Type
of text/html will be included.

You must check your site for broken links before running the script, the
recommended method is by using the W3C validator:

http://validator.w3.org/checklink

All of the packages required by this script should be installed by default
if you have a standard copy of Perl 5 with libwww-perl, although you may
need to install DateTime separately (there are Ubuntu/Debian packages
available via the standard repositories).

You may need to modify the path to Perl if you are running this script under
Windows or FreeBSD.

For details of any of the module function calls, see http://search.cpan.org
for full documentation.
